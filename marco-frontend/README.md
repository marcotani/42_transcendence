# Pong Frontend Skeleton

This is the skeleton for the Pong frontend project. It uses TypeScript and Tailwind CSS only (no React or other frameworks). The app is a single-page application, responsive, accessible, multilingual, and includes stats dashboards and AI logic.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `src/main.ts`: Entry point for TypeScript
- `src/styles.css`: Tailwind CSS entry
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind configuration
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `package.json`: Project scripts and dependencies

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Build CSS and TypeScript:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Start a local server (e.g. with `live-server` or similar) to view the SPA.
